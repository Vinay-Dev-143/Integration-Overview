# Integration Platform Overview Dashboard

A lightweight static dashboard that mirrors the provided layout: dark theme, colored section cards, hexagon nodes, and subtle connectors.

## Run
- Option 1: Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Option 2: Serve locally for best results (prevents font/icon blocking by some browsers):
  - On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    # Python 3
    py -m http.server 5173
    # then open http://localhost:5173
    ```

## Customize
- Edit `script.js` to change sections, colors, or server names.
- Styles are in `styles.css`.
